# Advancing and Promoting Quantum Computing Research Using Alliance DRI to Current and Future Quantum Scientists ‚öõÔ∏è
*Project Lead: Jaimie Greasley*


### Welcome to my repo!üëã

This Github repository was created within the framework of the [OLS Open Seeds Program](https://we-are-ols.org/openseeds/) with the intention to make aware of, describe, and keep track of the progression of my project entitled "*Advancing and Promoting Quantum Computing Research Using Alliance DRI to Current and Future Quantum Scientists*" for the [Digital Research Alliance of Canada's Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI) Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Accessibility (EDIA) Champions Program](https://alliancecan.ca/en/funding-opportunities/dri-edia-champions-pilot-program), and with further support from [Let's Talk Science Canada](https://letstalkscience.ca) organization. 

My project intends to engage the quantum computing research community as well as potential future quantum scientists on utilizing high-performance computing (HPC) for quantum computing with the Alliance's DRI. This will be achieved through high school science outreach events and research seminars. There will be a concerted effort made in reaching members of minority groups. 

The present repository contains a description of the project, its importance, along with the project roadmap.

## Project Background and Description :woman_technologist: :atom_symbol:

Presently, quantum processors are noisy and small and cannot currently facilitate the implementation  of fully-scaled quantum circuits for solving practical scientific problems. Quantum simulators, i.e. classical computers, can mimic quantum evolution processes that occur in real quantum systems, but only up to a limit. In quantum algorithms research, simulation is often the first route before executing a circuit on real quantum hardware. Conventional computers may be used for quantum simulation, but supercomputers provide much greater computational power. Large memory and processing power is an essential for quantum computation. Some quantum simulation methods are approximate and others are exact, but both are still limited in terms of dimensionality of the problem and/or circuit depth they can accurately capture. Since there are limits to the performance and accuracies of different quantum simulation methods, it is important to evaluate and compare them.

I propose to access and use the Alliance's available digital research infrastructure (DRI) for high-performance computing in exploring quantum algorithms. I shall evaluate various simulation methods and real quantum computing for performance and scalability using these facilities. With the success of this study, I then hope to promote the use of DRA infrastructure for quantum computing through a promotional video, seminars and science outreach activities and an introductory quantum programming tutorial website. 

## Project Vision and Mission :star2:
As a Digital Research Alliance (DRA) EDIA Champion, I aim to encourage the use of the DRA‚Äôs high-performance computing (HPC) resources for quantum computing education and research. Whilst these efforts would be extended to the interested field-relevant persons and groups within British Columbia, particular focus will be placed in reaching members of visible minorities and women.
For the research aspect, I am hoping to present and promote an alternative HPC resource platform for quantum researchers within BC, other than those which are more familiar or common in the field. With regards to education, I intend to target Vancouver Island schools for hosting introductory quantum computing workshops for high school students, particularly those with visible minority groups and women.

It is important that Canadian quantum researchers are aware of the HPC resources available to them so that they may themselves assess the most efficient and effective tools to make progress in the field. It is also important that visible minority groups and women are not limited to opportunities in choosing and advancing their careers in technological fields within Canada.

## Roadmap :thought_balloon:

The project roadmap can be found [here](https://github.com/Jaim-gem/OLS-program/blob/main/roadmap.md). 

## Target Audience :loud_sound:

 The primary audience for these targeted events are high school students within Vancouver Island and the quantum computing research network within British Columbia.

 Once the material is promoted online, it will be accesible to all interested persons.

## Access to Materials :books:

Once the materials for the project are available, the repository will be updated with a directed link to the content. 


## Contributors :handshake:

Contributions to the current project come from affiliate researchers and personnel at the University of Victoria. Support is also garnered from Let‚Äôs Talk Science (LTS) Canada for promoting and organizing science outreach events.

 One research-driven seminar is being hosted by the [Black in Quantum](https://www.linkedin.com/black-in-quantum/)
organization.
