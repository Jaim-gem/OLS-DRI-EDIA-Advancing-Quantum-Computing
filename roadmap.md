# Alliance DRI EDIA Champions Project Roadmap

## Title: &nbsp; "Advancing and Promoting Quantum Computing Using Alliance DRI to Current and Future Quantum Scientists"

*Project Lead: Jaimie Greasley*

### Project Summary and Mission :rocket:

The limitations of present-day quantum hardware for implementing scaled quantum circuits - and thereby solving practical scientific problems - are well acknowledged. High-performance computing (HPC) is a suitable alternative for preliminary quantum simulations in the current and near-term. This proposal aims to leverage the Digital Research Alliance's (DRA) HPC infrastructure to evaluate different quantum simulation methods, and promote the DRA's resources as an additional platform available to quantum computing researchers across Canada. 

Additionally, this initiative focuses on advancing quantum computing education through outreach workshops for high school students on Vancouver Island, and potentially targeting women and visible minorities. The goal is to raise awareness of Canadian HPC resources among quantum researchers and to foster diversity in technological fields.

### Project Milestone 1: Short Promotional Video Series :clapper:

**Description** 
This video series features a tour of the Arbutus Data Center at the University of Victoria and how the facility is run, in order to garner an appreciation for high-performance computing behind-the-scenes. Furthermore, various research groups at the University of Victoria are spotlightlighted on the nature of their work and their use of DRA's HPC resources.  

**Tasks** 
- Invitations to UVic personnel, faculty and students to participate in video project
- Coordination with Media Services
- Project filming
- Preliminary editing 
- First review and second editing 
- Video finalization 
- Social media promotion

### Project Milestone 2: Quantum Computing and Programming Workshop for High School Students :woman_technologist: :man_technologist: :atom_symbol:

**Description** 

The high school outreach is in collaboration with Let's Talk Science Canada. The workshop entails a simple introduction to high performance computing, quantum computing and basic quantum programming. Program materials includes one of the promotional videos, prepared interactive slides, a demo kit, and a programming tutorial website.

**Tasks** 
- Preliminary workshop program and tutorial website development 
- Workshop program and website review and finalization
- 1-3 High school visits
- Computer Science Symposium for high school students at University of Victoria on February 20, 2025. 
- Social media promotion

### Project Milestone 3: Quantum Webinar(s) on Quantum Computing Research using Alliance DRI :calendar:

**Description**

I shall use the strong network of quantum computing research groups and organizations within British Columbia to host the webinars on the use of DRA's research infrasture resources for quantum computing and specifically highlight my own experience. 


**Tasks** 
- Digital Research Alliance HPC training 
- Preliminary tests using Qiskit, Snowflurry and DMRJulia 
- Main project 
- Finalizing results 
- Report write-up
- Seminar preparation 
- 1-2 Seminars 
- Social media promotion
